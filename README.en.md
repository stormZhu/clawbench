**From Terminal to Palm** — An AI workstation built for mobile.

Brings the full power of AI coding agents to browsers and mobile apps, creating a true mobile development environment. File browsing, code editing, AI conversation, Git operations, scheduled tasks — one app does it all.

Core Advantage: Native passthrough of AI capabilities (tool calls, extended thinking, Skills, MCP) with zero adaptation cost, fully preserving the power of coding agents. Unlike other mobile AI tools that are merely "remote controllers," ClawBench is a full-featured mobile workstation — files, code, Git, AI, scheduled tasks, TTS, get real work done on your phone without needing a PC online.

- **Supported Platforms**: Browser (PC / Tablet / Phone), Android App, PWA
- **AI Backends**: CodeBuddy, Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Qoder CLI, VeCLI, CodeWhale, MiMo-Code, Pi, Copilot, Kimi, Grok, Antigravity

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **A PC (Linux / macOS / Windows)**: To run the ClawBench server, with at least one supported AI coding agent installed (CodeBuddy, Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Qoder CLI, VeCLI, CodeWhale, MiMo-Code, Pi, Copilot, Kimi, Grok, or Antigravity)
- **A phone**: Install the [ClawBench Android App](https://github.com/xulongzhe/clawbench/releases), or use a mobile browser (Chrome recommended) to access the server address

### npm Install

Install via npm in one command:

```bash
npm install -g @xulongzhe/clawbench
# Start
clawbench
```

Supports Linux (x64/arm64), macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), and Windows (x64). npm automatically selects the correct platform-specific binary package.

### Download & Start

Download the latest ZIP package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xulongzhe/clawbench/releases), extract and you're ready:

```bash
wget https://github.com/xulongzhe/clawbench/releases/latest/download/clawbench-linux-amd64.zip
unzip clawbench-linux-amd64.zip
cd clawbench
./clawbench
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/clawbench-dev/clawbench:latest
docker run -d -p 20000:20000 -v clawbench-data:/data ghcr.io/clawbench-dev/clawbench:latest
```

Customize the host port with `-p` (e.g., `-p 20300:20000`). The `clawbench-data` volume persists all data. To view the auto-generated password:

```bash
docker exec $(docker ps -qf ancestor=ghcr.io/clawbench-dev/clawbench) cat /data/.clawbench/auto-password
```

> A random 8-character hex password is auto-generated on first startup and printed to the console in a bordered box. Save it securely.

Once deployed, access `http://server-ip:20000` from your phone app or mobile browser:

- **Phone App**: Native integration, auto-connect, full feature support
- **Mobile Browser**: **Chrome** recommended — supports installing as a PWA app (Add to Home Screen) for a near-native experience

> 📡 **Public Access**: To access ClawBench from the public internet (commuting, traveling, etc.), see the **[Public Access Guide](docs/PUBLIC_ACCESS.md)**  — supports IPv6 direct connection, FRP tunnel, and EasyTier decentralized networking (no VPS required).
